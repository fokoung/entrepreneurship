# A school entrepreneurship project
That little story highlights a major challenge: today, children hear about big global issues, like the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). But for them, these goals often remain abstract, distant, and disconnected from their daily lives. The problem isn't that they don't care; it's that they don't see how they, at their level, can make a difference. The connection between knowing and doing is often broken.

How does it work? We transform each Sustainable Development Goal into a captivating 'Mission.' On our platform, children explore an interactive world map, discovering fun courses filled with videos, stories, and games. They learn what concepts like 'No Poverty,' 'Gender Equality,' or 'Climate Action' actually mean in ways they can understand.

But the learning doesn't stop there. We encourage kids to take action in the real world through our 'Challenges.' This could be anything from a recycling challenge at home, saving water, or performing an act of kindness in their community. Every action counts!

And to make the adventure even more motivating, every completed mission and challenge earns kids points, unique badges, and official certificates to collect in their personal profile.
